# ICS0031 

## Branches:

Due to enlightement brought onto me by getting hired and looking into what my company might need in the future, as well as what I deem is a fun/useful (for me) language, I decided to switch to Go.
Due to this the deadlines will suffer but I think the payoff is going to be worth it.
